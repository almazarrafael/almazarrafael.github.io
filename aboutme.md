   My name is **Rafael Almazar**. I was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. in 2014 and now I am currently living in Sun Valley (Los Angeles), California. I am currently a 2nd year student in **California State University, Northridge** and I am majoring in **Computer Engineering**. I've only taken Comp 110 which is Introduction to Algorithms and Programming (Java), but on my spare time I've delved into other side projects. In my first year of college, I worked with CSUN VEX Robotics as much as I can. I worked on and off as a programmer and builder for my team on and off because I had to balance that and my classes. I aim to work more on programming and building more arduino projects this summer of 2019. 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
