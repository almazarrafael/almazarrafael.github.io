My name is Rafael Almazar. I am currently a student in California State University, Northridge and I am majoring in Computer Engineering. 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
