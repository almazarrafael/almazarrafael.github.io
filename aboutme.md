<h1> <center> <font color="#DB324D"> me  </font> </center> </h1>

My name is **Rafael Almazar**. I'm 18 years old and I was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. in 2014 and now I am currently living in Sun Valley (Los Angeles), California. I love learning and doing new things and I aim to showcase the things that I've worked on here.

I'm really interested in all things **Science and Technology**. I also love listening to music, watching movies, skating around, learning new things and trying new hobbies. I also love **Geography and World History**. I plan on memorizing the name of every country and its location on the map.

So far, I've only taken Comp 110, Introduction to Algorithms and Programming (Java), but on my spare time I've gone into doing other side projects. In my first year of college, I worked with college's robotics team, CSUN VEX Robotics, as much as I can. I worked on and off as a programmer and builder for my team. On and off because I had to balance participating in the club and my classes. I aim to work more on programming and building more arduino projects.
