Hi, I'm **Rafael Almazar**. I'm from the Philippines, but I moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue the good ol' American dream. I'm a student at **California State University, Northridge** majoring in Computer Engineering. I love learning new things in and outside of school and I'll be showcasing some of the things I've made on this website! Some of the other things that I love are playing games, skating around, breaking things and building things. I also work as a Math tutor at CSUN, tutoring in all classes ranging from Algebra to Calculus. I also worked with CSUN's robotics team, **CSUN VEX Robotics**, for a year as a programmer and mechanical builder for my team.
