I made this game because I had nothing else to do for my class and I really wanted to make something with the things that I've learned. This game utilizes everything that I learned when I made it halfway through Comp 110.

## how to play

1. Buy ingredients.
2. Make lemonade.
3. Sell lemonade.
4. Random events may happen everyday.
5. Lemonade prices will fluctuate everyday.

## what I learned

I used everything that I learned in Comp 110 (Intro to Computer Science) when I made this which includes conditional statements, loops, arrays, switch cases, method structures and file read/write.
Rudimentary save/load system using file read/write that inputs each line in a file into a variable.

## notes

If I had a chance to do this again, I would implement object oriented programming because a lot of main file could have been sectioned off. I think this was a really good side project which really helped me fully understand the material that was being taught at the time.
